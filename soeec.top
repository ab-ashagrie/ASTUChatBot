u: (["what is" "tell me about"] ~cse) The mission of the Computer Science and Engineering CSE program is to provide students with a broad and flexible education in
computer science and engineering, to prepare its graduates for rapidly changing technological fields, and give them a sound basis for
professional practice, advanced education, active citizenship, and lifelong learning. The students are prepared to expand this
knowledge through research into new technologies, design methods, and analysis techniques that link the knowledge with multidisciplinary
fields and advance the state of the art. With a knowledge of contemporary technological issues and their impact globally,
economically, and environmentally, computer scientists and engineers are at the forefront of advances that continually transform
society.
CSE undergraduate program tries to make balance among three spinoffs; Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Computer
Engineering. This scheme exactly fits and aligned with the latest ACM curriculum directions, which considers best and tested
experience internationally. Course distribution in each semester is well planned and structured to harness knowledge from the three
spinoffs into computer science and engineering knowledge domain. Elective courses gives opportunity for program student to make
more stable basement in one of the spinoffs for further study, without compromising computer science and engineering knowledge
domain.
CSE postgraduate program is flexible, student oriented, and research driven program. Except one course, all courses are elective.
There are seven course clusters, supposedly specialty steams in the PG curriculum.
Algorithm and computation 
Artificial Intelligence
Software Engineering
Systems and Networks
Computer Architecture
Computer Vision, Graphics and Robotics
Network and Information Systems Security
SIG Special interest groups:
Special interest group, particularly research groups, are groups of people (preferably not less than three) who are devoted doing
researches on specific areas in main and latest stream of CSE. An individual who is a professor on the area will lead the group.SIG
group members are comprised of mainly program academic staff members, and PG and UG students. By its nature, SIGs are
composed of multidisciplinary field of studies; hence members could come from different programs from the same school or even
different schools.
Each research group main duties are (1) making discussion on scientific research outputs including journals, seminar and conference
papers, brain storming on current status on science and technology, (2) disseminating the knowledge the University community by
conducting seminars and other means, (3) and actively participate in scientific paper publications in the respective focus areas. In the
aspect of establishing and strengthening the program, these groups plays vital roles in developing and reviewing course contents, also
standardizing and managing labs for both undergraduate and post graduate programs. Research groups grow in to a particular post
graduate program, and eventually into a research center in the area.
Currently, the following SIG are active in the program
Intelligent Systems
Data Science
Cloud Computing and distributed system
Network Science 
Computer vision and Robotics

u: (["what is" "tell me about"] ~epce) The program of Electrical Power and Control Engineering (EPCE) is one of the three programs in the School of Electrical Engineering
and Computing in Adama Science and Technology University. The Program is aimed in serving the country by producing engineers
and researchers who are playing key roles in the various sectors of development in the country and also advanced the Universityâ€™s
reputation. The core strategy of the Program is to pursue its vision and mission to enhance its research, linkage with industry,
academic and scholarly activities and become a center of excellence for its programs, thereby improving its eminence in national and
international rankings.
The program has three areas of specialization at master level, namely:
ELECTRICAL POWER ENGINEERING
CONTROL ENGINEERING
POWER ELECTRONICS
Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of energy engineering and electrical engineering that
deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power and the electrical devices connected to such
systems including generators, motors and transformers. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of power, the
standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world, a significant fraction of the field is concerned
with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for
electric railway networks.
Control engineering or control systems engineering is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems
with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those
measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a
device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for
regulating the speed of a car). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control
systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range. Its main focus is on automation of system, fuzzy
logic, mechatronics, etc
Power electronics is the application of solid-state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. It is the bridge
between electrical power and control engineering. It also refers to a subject of research in electronic and electrical engineering which
deals with the design, control, computation and integration of nonlinear, time-varying energy-processing electronic systems with fast
dynamics. In modern systems the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors and
transistors. In contrast to electronic systems concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data, in power electronics
substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed. An AC/DC converter (rectifier) is the most typical power electronics device
found in many consumer electronic devices. The power range is typically from tens of watts to several hundred watts. In industry a
common application is the variable speed drive (VSD) that is used to control an induction motor. The power ranges of VSDs start
from a few hundred watts and end at tens of megawatts.
The program has sufficient PhD staffs to teach and advise the students. Moreover, the laboratory facilities are too the standard and it is
well organized. Currently, the university is also purchasing very huge high technology laboratory equipment.
